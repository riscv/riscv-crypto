== Macro-op Fusion Recommendations

This document contains recommendations for
macro-op fusion in RISC-V cores that will be particularly helpful
for cryptography.

=== Scope and Background

We use the following criteria to identify recommended macro-op fusions
and associated code sequences:

- We focus on pairs of instructions to fuse. Longer sequences are
  possible but harder to utilise.

- We focus on sequences which read two register operands, and write
  a single register operand. This constraint means that even the most
  simple RISC-V implementation doesn't need to add ports to its register
  file.

- We focus on instructions which will appear in an RV32I, or RV64I
  architecture, with the scalar cryptography instructions also implemented.

- We separately consider cases where the compressed `C` instructions are
  also implemented.

- For modelling performance gains, we assume all integer instructions
  have unit latency, and ignore the costs of loops.

Where the `C` extension is implemented, the shortest (in bytes) possible
fusable sequence is two instructions of two bytes each.
The longest two instruction sequence we consider in all cases is
eight bytes.
The longest sequence a core can fuse is hence limited by the size of its
instruction decode buffer.
A simple implementation of RV32IC (or RV64IC) will have a 48-bit
instruction buffer - primarily to handle the case of jumping onto
a 16-bit aligned 32-bit instruction.
Hence, fusable sequences consisting of two 16-bit instructions or
one 16-bit and one 32-bit instruction are of particular interest.

The `C` extension instructions are designed to expand into normal,
32-bit instructions. However, they can only address a subset of the
registers. We repeat table 16.1 from Volume 1 of the RISC-V instruction
set manual here:

.Registers addressable by compressed instructions.

=== Recommended Fusion Sequences

Note that these tables assume that the scalar Cryptography instructions
from Bitmanip have been implemented, namely: 

- `andn rD, rA, rB // rD = rA & ~rB`
- `orn  rD, rA, rB // rD = rA | ~rB`
- `xnor rD, rA, rB // rD = rA ^ ~rB`

The Size column gives the size of the instruction sequence in bytes.

=== Case Study: ChaCha20

The ChaCha20 stream cipher<<RFC8439>> uses the following
quarter round (`QR`) function:

----
#define QR(a,b,c,d)                 \
a += b;  d ^= a;  d = ROTL(d,16);   \
c += d;  b ^= c;  b = ROTL(b,12);   \
a += b;  d ^= a;  d = ROTL(d, 8);   \
c += d;  b ^= c;  b = ROTL(b, 7);   \
----

which, when displayed graphically, looks like:

image::https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/ChaCha_Cipher_Quarter_Round_Function.svg/382px-ChaCha_Cipher_Quarter_Round_Function.svg.png[ChaCha20 Round Function Diagram]

https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=90771650[Diagram By Tony Arcieri - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0]

Squares represent the additions modulo 32, circles represent bit-wise
XOR, and `<<<_x` is a 32-bit left rotation by `x`.

A complete ChaCha20 round is then expressed as:

----
QR(x[0], x[4], x[ 8], x[12]);
QR(x[1], x[5], x[ 9], x[13]);
QR(x[2], x[6], x[10], x[14]);
QR(x[3], x[7], x[11], x[15]);
QR(x[0], x[5], x[10], x[15]);
QR(x[1], x[6], x[11], x[12]); 
QR(x[2], x[7], x[ 8], x[13]); 
QR(x[3], x[4], x[ 9], x[14]); 
----

where `x` is the 16-element array of `32`-bit words representing the
round state.

When implemented on RV32I with the scalar cryptography extensions,
the `QR` function requires 12 instructions.
One round is hence `48` instructions.

There is one fusable sequence which meets our criteria:

----
xor  rA, rA, rB
rori rA, rA, imm
----

Note there is no "rotate left by immediate" instruction, so
we use the the "rotate right by immediate" with an adjusted immediate.
Note also that there is no 16-bit rotate instruction, but there
is a 16-bit xor instruction which fits the `xor rA, rA, rB`  pattern.

The ChaCha20 state consists of 16 32-bit words. All of which can be
kept in the registers of an RV32I/RV64I implementation.
However, only eight words may be kept in registers addressable by
the compressed instructions, and so maximise the opportunities
for fusion.

Two compressed instruction registers (`s0`, `s1`) must be saved to
the stack before being used. This will cost at minimum `6` instructions
per call to a ChaCha20 block function: two stack adjustments, two
stores and two loads.

The `a0` and `a1` registers may also need their contents moving prior to
entering the block round loop, since they are used to pass parameters
to functions. For the ChaCha20 block function, this will likely be
the input/output array pointers. This will cost two instructions to
move them from `a0` / `a1`. If the arguments are marked as `const` in
C code, then two more instructions are needed to put them back.

A core capable of fusing this sequence when both instructions are upto
32 bits long saves  `4` cycles per quarter round.

A core capable of fusing this sequence only when the xor is 16 bits and
the rori is 32 bits is more complex to analyse.
Looking at the data flow graph, the fusable sequences takes their
inputs from either variables `a` and `d`, or `b` and `c`.
Looking at how a complete ChaCha20 round is structured, it then becomes
clear that either state elements `x[0..4,12..15]`, or `x[4..11]`
are the ones best placed
in the compressed instruction registers `s0,s1,a0,...,a5`, since this
creates the largest number of fusable 48-bit instruction sequences.
In either case, two occurrences of sequence 1 are fusable.
Hence a quarter round is then `10` cycles and a round `40` cycles.

A core which can only fuse two 16-bit instructions is incapable
of fusing sequence 1.


=== Case Study: Keccak

*Note:* this section repeatedly refers to 
https://github.com/mjosaarinen/lwsha_isa/blob/master/sha3_rv64_keccakp.c[Markku's implementation]
of the Keccak round function on RV64.
Though based on RV64, the sequences here also apply to RV32.

==== rotate + xor

The Keccak Round function uses `5` instances of the sequence

----
rori    rD, rA, imm
xor     rD, rD, rB
----

A core capable of fusing this sequence when both instructions are
`32` bits long will save `5` cycles per Keccak round, or `125` in
total.

==== xor + rotate

The Keccak Round function uses `25` instances of
xor-then-rotate-by-immediate.

----
xor     rA, rA, rB
rori    rA, rA, imm
----

A core capable of fusing this sequence when both instructions are
`32` bits long with save `25` cycles per round, or `625` cycles in total.

==== andn + xor

The `chi` step of the Keccak round function consists of the expression
`x ^= (y & ~z)`. Hence the sequence:

----
andn    rD, rA, rB
xor     rD, rD, rC
----

A core capable of fusing this 8-byte sequence wil save `20` cycles per
round, or `500` cycles in total.

==== xor + xor

The `theta` step of Keccak uses five `xor` reductions of five variables
each: `tmp = A^B^C^D^E`. Being able to fuse the sequence

----
xor     rD, rA, rB
xor     rD, rD, rC
----

Saves two cycles per reduction, or 10 per round, which is 250 in
total.

=== Case Study: SHA2

The SHA2 algorithms use two ternary non-linear functions: `Ch` and `Maj`.
There is a discussion in the 
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/blob/master/doc/supp/bitlogic.adoc[bitlogic]
document on how best to implement these functions given the base instruction
set and the Bitmanip extension.
Here, we only discuss the relevant macro-op fusion sequences for
the Cryptography extension.

----
Ch(x,y,z)  = z ^ (x & (y ^ z))
Maj(x,y,z) = x ^ ((x ^ y) & (x ^ z))  
----

For the `Ch` function, we can fuse *either* the `xor+and` or the `and+xor`
instruction pairs:

----
xor  rT, rY, rZ
and  rT, rT, rX
xor  rT, rT, rZ
----

Also note that the result of `Ch` cannot always overwrite its inputs, making
it difficult to use the compressed instruction extensions.
In the sequence above, the inputs are not overwritten, and the
`and` and `xor` instructions *can* use the compressed forms.

For the `Maj` function,the same `and/xor` fusion sequences can be used.
The following code assumes the input variables cannot be overwritten.

----
xor rA, rX, rZ
xor rB, rX, rY  //
and rB, rB, rA  // Fuse the xor/and, or the and/xor.
xor rB, rB, rX  //
----


=== Security Considerations

These considerations are taken in the context of macro-op fusion generally,
not just the recommendations listed in this document.

Where some algorithm must compute either `A` or `B` based on the value
of some secret `C`, it is essential that `A` and `B` take the same
length of time to compute. Otherwise an adversary who can measure
execution time can learn something of `C`.
One method of doing this is control flow balancing, where
either `A` or `B` is artificially padded with instructions such that
they take the same time to execute. If the programmer or compiler
does not know exactly when a core will fuse certain macro-ops, it
is possible that `A` and `B` will become un-balanced again, because
one path includes a fusable sequence and the other does not.
This may be addressed by computing both `A` and `B` regardless of
`C`, and selecting the appropriate result in a constant time fashion.
