[[zbkb,Zbkb]]
=== `Zbkb` - Bitmanip instructions for Cryptography

These are a subset of the Bitmanipulation Extension `Zbb` which are
particularly useful for Cryptography.

NOTE: Some of these instructions are defined in the first Bitmanip
ratification package, and some are not (
<<insns-pack,pack>>,
<<insns-packh,packh>>,
<<insns-packw,packw>>,
<<insns-brev8,brev8>>,
<<insns-zip,zip>>,
<<insns-unzip,unzip>>).
All of the instructions in <<zbkb>> have their complete specification included
in this document, including those _not_ present in the initial
Bitmanip ratification package.
This is to make the specification complete as a standalone document.
Inevitably there might be small divergences between the Bitmanip and
Scalar Cryptography specification documents as they move at different
paces.
When this happens, assume that the Bitmanip specification has the
most up-to-date version of Bitmanip instructions.
This is an unfortunate but necessary stop-gap while Scalar Cryptography
and Bitmanip are being rapidly iterated on prior to public review.
