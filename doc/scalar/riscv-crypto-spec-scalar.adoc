This document describes the Scalar Cryptography extensions to the 
RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture.

This document is in the link:http://riscv.org/spec-state[Frozen state].
Change is extremely unlikely. A high threshold will be used, and a change
will only occur because of some truly critical issue being identified during
the public review cycle. Any other desired or needed changes can be the
subject of a follow-on new extension.
For more information, see link:http://riscv.org/spec-state[here].

== Extensions Overview

The group of extensions introduced by the Scalar Cryptography Instruction Set
Extension is listed here.

Detection of individual cryptography extensions uses the
unified software-based RISC-V discovery method.

[NOTE]
====
At the time of writing, these discovery mechanisms are still a work in
progress.

.A note on extension rationale
[NOTE, caption="SH"]
====
Specialist encryption and decryption instructions are separated into different
functional groups because some use cases (e.g., Galois/Counter
Mode in TLS 1.3) do not require decryption functionality.

The NIST and ShangMi algorithms suites are separated because their
usefulness is heavily dependent on the countries a device is expected to
operate in. NIST ciphers are a part of most standardised internet
protocols, while ShangMi ciphers are required for use in China.

=== `Zkt` - Data Independent Execution Latency

This extension allows CPU implementers to indicate to
cryptographic software developers that a subset of RISC-V instructions
are guaranteeed to be implemented such that their execution latency
is independent of the data values they operate on.
A complete description of this extension is found in
<<crypto_scalar_zkt>>.
