[[crypto_scalar_policies]]
=== Policies

In creating this proposal, we tried to adhere to the following
policies:

* Where there is a choice between:
  1) supporting diverse implementation strategies for an algorithm
  or
  2) supporting a single implementation style which is more performant /
     less expensive;
  the crypto extension will pick the more constrained but performant
  option.
  This fits a common pattern in other parts of the RISC-V specification,
  where recommended (but not required) instruction sequences for performing
  particular tasks are given as an example, such that both hardware and
  software implementers can optimise for only a single use-case.
  
* The extension will be designed to support _existing_ standardised
  cryptographic constructs well.
  It will not try to support proposed standards, or cryptographic
  constructs which exist only in academia.
  Cryptographic standards which are settled upon concurrently with, or after
  the RISC-V cryptographic extension standardisation will be dealt with
  by future additions to, or versions of, the RISC-V cryptographic
  standard extension. It is anticipated that the NIST Lightweight
  Cryptography contest, and the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography contest
  may be dealt with this way, depending on timescales.
  
* Historically, there has been some discussion
  cite:[LSYRR:04]
  on how newly supported operations in general-purpose computing might
  enable new bases for cryptographic algorithms.
  The standard will not try to anticipate new useful low-level
  operations which _may_ be useful as building blocks for
  future cryptographic constructs.
  
* Regarding side-channel countermeasures:
  Where relevant, proposed instructions must aim to remove the
  possibility of any timing side-channels.
  For side-channels based on power or electro-magnetic (EM) measurements,
  the extension will not aim to support countermeasures which are
  implemented above the ISA abstraction layer.
  Recommendations will be given where relevant on how micro-architectures
  can implement instructions in a power/EM side-channel resistant way.
