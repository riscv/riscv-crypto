Description:: 
This instruction is supported for the RV32 and RV64 base architectures.
It implements the _P0_ transform of the SM3 hash function cite:[gbt:sm3,iso:sm3].
This instruction must _always_ be implemented such that its execution
latency does not depend on the data being operated on.

[NOTE]
====
This instruction is based on work done in cite:[MJS:LWSHA:20].

Operation::
[source,sail]
--
function clause execute (SM3P0(rs1, rd)) = {
  let r1     : bits(32) = X(rs1)[31..0];
  let result : bits(32) =  r1 ^ rol32(r1,  9) ^ rol32(r1, 17);
  X(rd) = EXTS(result);
  RETIRE_SUCCESS
}
