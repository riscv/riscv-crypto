Synopsis::
Accelerates the block encrypt/decrypt operation of the SM4 block cipher

{bits: 7, name: 0x33},
{bits: 5, name: 'rd'},

Description:: 
Implements a T-tables in hardware style approach to accelerating the
SM4 round function.
A byte is extracted from `rs2` based on `bs`, to which the SBox and
linear layer transforms are applied, before the result is XOR'd with
`rs1` and written back to `rd`.
This instruction exists on RV32 and RV64 base architectures.
On RV64, the 32-bit result is sign extended upto XLEN bits.
This instruction must _always_ be implemented such that its execution
latency does not depend on the data being operated on.

Operation::
[source,sail]
--
function clause execute (SM4ED (bs,rs2,rs1,rd)) = {
  let shamt : bits(5)  = bs @ 0b000; /* shamt = bs*8 */
  let sb_in : bits(8)  = (X(rs2)[31..0] >> shamt)[7..0];
  let x     : bits(32) = 0x000000 @ sm4_sbox(sb_in);
  let y     : bits(32) = x ^ (x               <<  8) ^ ( x               <<  2) ^
                             (x               << 18) ^ ((x & 0x0000003F) << 26) ^
                             ((x & 0x000000C0) << 10);
  let z     : bits(32) = rol32(y, unsigned(shamt));
  let result: bits(32) = z ^ X(rs1)[31..0];
  X(rd)                = EXTS(result);
