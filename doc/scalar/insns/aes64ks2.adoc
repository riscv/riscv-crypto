[#insns-aes64ks2, reftext="AES Key Schedule Instruction 2 (RV64)"]
=== aes64ks2

Synopsis::
This instruction implements part of the KeySchedule operation for the
AES Block cipher.

Mnemonic::
aes64ks2 rd, rs1, rs2

Encoding::
[wavedrom, , svg]
....
{reg:[
{bits: 7, name: 0x33},
{bits: 5, name: 'rd'},
{bits: 3, name: 0x0},
{bits: 5, name: 'rs1'},
{bits: 5, name: 'rs2'},
{bits: 5, name: 0x1f},
{bits: 2, name: 0x1},
]}

Description:: 
This instruction implements the additional XOR'ing of key words as
part of the AES block cipher Key Schedule.
This instruction must _always_ be implemented such that its execution
latency does not depend on the data being operated on.

Operation::
[source,sail]
--
function clause execute (AES64KS2(rs2, rs1, rd)) = {
  let w0 : bits(32) = X(rs1)[63..32] ^ X(rs2)[31..0];
  let w1 : bits(32) = X(rs1)[63..32] ^ X(rs2)[31..0] ^ X(rs2)[63..32];
  X(rd)  = w1 @ w0;
  RETIRE_SUCCESS
}
