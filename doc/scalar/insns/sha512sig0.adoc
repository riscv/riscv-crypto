=== sha512sig0

Synopsis::
Implements the Sigma0 transformation function as used in
the SHA2-512 hash function cite:[nist:fips:180:4] (Section 4.1.3).

Mnemonic::

Description:: 
This instruction is supported for the RV64 base architecture.
It implements the Sigma0 transform of the SHA2-512 hash function.
cite:[nist:fips:180:4].
This instruction must _always_ be implemented such that its execution
latency does not depend on the data being operated on.

Operation::
[source,sail]
--
function clause execute (SHA512SIG0(rs1, rd)) = {
  X(rd) = ror64(X(rs1),  1) ^ ror64(X(rs1),  8) ^ (X(rs1) >> 7);
  RETIRE_SUCCESS
}
--
