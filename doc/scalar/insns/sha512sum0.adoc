=== sha512sum0

Synopsis::
Implements the Sum0 transformation function as used in
the SHA2-512 hash function cite:[nist:fips:180:4] (Section 4.1.3).

Mnemonic::

Description:: 
This instruction is supported for the RV64 base architecture.
It implements the Sum0 transform of the SHA2-512 hash function.
cite:[nist:fips:180:4].
This instruction must _always_ be implemented such that it's execution
latency does not depend on the data being operated on.

Operation::
[source,sail]
--
function clause execute (SHA512SUM0(rs1, rd)) = {
  X(rd) = ror64(X(rs1), 28) ^ ror64(X(rs1), 34) ^ ror64(X(rs1) ,39);
  RETIRE_SUCCESS
}
