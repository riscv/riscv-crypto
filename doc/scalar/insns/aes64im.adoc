[#insns-aes64im, reftext="AES Decrypt KeySchedule MixColumns (RV64)"]
=== aes64im

Synopsis::
This instruction accelerates the inverse MixColumns step of the AES
Block Cipher, and is used to aid creation of the decryption KeySchedule.

Mnemonic::
aes64im rd, rs1

Encoding::

....
{reg:[
{bits: 7, name: 0x13},
{bits: 5, name: 'rd'},
{bits: 3, name: 0x1},
{bits: 5, name: 'rs1'},
{bits: 5, name: 0x0},
{bits: 5, name: 0x18},
{bits: 2, name: 0x0},
]}
....

Description:: 
The instruction applies the inverse MixColumns
transformation to two columns of the state array, packed into a single
64-bit register.
It is used to create the inverse cipher KeySchedule, according to
the equivalent inverse cipher construction in
cite:[nist:fips:197] (Page 23, Section 5.3.5).
This instruction must _always_ be implemented such that its execution
latency does not depend on the data being operated on.

Operation::
[source,sail]
--
function clause execute (AES64IM(rs1, rd)) = {
  let w0 : bits(32) = aes_mixcolumn_inv(X(rs1)[31.. 0]);
  let w1 : bits(32) = aes_mixcolumn_inv(X(rs1)[63..32]);
  X(rd)  = w1 @ w0;
  RETIRE_SUCCESS
}
