[#insns-sha512sig0l, reftext="SHA2-512 Sigma0 low (RV32)"]
=== sha512sig0l

Synopsis::
Implements the _low half_ of the Sigma0 transformation, as
used in the SHA2-512 hash function cite:[nist:fips:180:4] (Section 4.1.3).

Mnemonic::
sha512sig0l rd, rs1, rs2

{bits: 7, name: 0x33},
{bits: 5, name: 'rd'},
{bits: 3, name: 0x0},

Description:: 
This instruction is implemented on RV32 only.
Used to compute the Sigma0 transform of the SHA2-512 hash function
in conjunction with the <<insns-sha512sig0h,`sha512sig0h`>> instruction.
The transform is a 64-bit to 64-bit function, so the input and output
is represented by two 32-bit registers.
This instruction must _always_ be implemented such that its execution
latency does not depend on the data being operated on.

[TIP]
.Note to software developers
====
The entire Sigma0 transform for SHA2-512 may be computed on RV32
using the following instruction sequence:

 sha512sig0l    t0, a0, a1 
 sha512sig0h    t1, a0, a1 

====

Operation::
[source,sail]
--
function clause execute (SHA512SIG0L(rs2, rs1, rd)) = {
  X(rd) = EXTS((X(rs1) >>  1) ^ (X(rs1) >>  7) ^ (X(rs1) >>  8) ^
               (X(rs2) << 31) ^ (X(rs2) << 25) ^ (X(rs2) << 24) );
  RETIRE_SUCCESS
}
