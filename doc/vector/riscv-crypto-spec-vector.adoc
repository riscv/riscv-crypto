This document describes the Vector Cryptography extensions to the 
RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture.

This document is _stable_ and limited changes should be
expected.

[[crypto_vector_extensions]]
== Extensions Overview

The section introduces all of the  extensions in the Vector Cryptography
Instruction Set Extension Specification.

The <<zvknh,Zvknhb>> and <<zvbc>> Vector Crypto Extensions
--and accordingly the composite extensions <<Zvkn>> and <<Zvks>>--
require a Zve64x base,
or application ("V") base Vector Extension.

All of the other Vector Crypto Extensions can be built
on _any_ embedded (Zve*) or application ("V") base Vector Extension.

// See <<crypto-vector-element-groups>> for more details on vector element groups and the drawbacks of
// small `VLEN` values.


All _cryptography-specific_ instructions defined in this Vector Crypto specification (i.e., those specified 
in <<zvkned>>, <<zvknh,Zvknh[ab]>>, <<Zvkg>>, <<Zvksed>> and <<zvksh>> but _not_ <<zvbb>> or <<zvbc>>) shall
be executed with data-independent execution latency as defined in the 
link:https://github.com/riscv/riscv-crypto/releases/tag/v1.0.1-scalar[RISC-V Scalar Cryptography Extensions specification].
It is important to note that the Vector Crypto instructions are independent of the
implementation of the `Zkt` extension and do not require that `Zkt` is implemented.

This specification includes a <<Zvkt>> extension that, when implemented, requires certain vector instructions
(including <<zvbb>> and <<zvbc>>) to be executed with data-independent execution latency.

Detection of individual cryptography extensions uses the
unified software-based RISC-V discovery method.

[NOTE]
====
At the time of writing, these discovery mechanisms are still a work in
progress.
