[[zvknh2,Zvknh2]]
=== `Zvknh2` - NIST Suite: Vector SHA-512

Instructions for accelerating SHA-512
// TODO - split this into two extensions; one with EGW=128 and another for EGW=256

All of these instructions work on 256-bit element groups, and hence
require that `Zvl256b` must be supported.


Systems which do not meet these requirements cannot support the <<zvknh2>>
extension.

// It is _possible_ to formulate these instructions such that they work
// on systems with a narrower `VLEN` (i.e 32 or 64) and use `LMUL=2,4` to
// create inputs which are large enough to contain enough information.
// However, this incurs a large amount of complexity in the instructions
// design and implementation.

Systems which implement `VLEN<256` should consider the existing
Scalar Cryptography Extensions, specifically <<Zkne,Zkne>> and <<Zknd,Zknd>>
for accelerated cryptographic operations.
